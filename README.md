# To-do Expo Application ‚úèÔ∏è



I created an application with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) which runs on my Android device using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client).

You can test it yourself if you [click on this link](https://expo.dev/@liadensam/TodoApp) with your phone:


- it will either let you know to install Expo Go
- or it will redirect you to the Expo Go and you can start trying it

Another possibility is to clone the repository:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/liadensam/expo-todo.git
```


And then install all dependencies  with:

```sh
npm install
```


And then run it by using:


```sh
expo start
```


Then make sure that your computer and your mobile device are connected the same stable network (wi-fi). Install and open Expo Go on your mobile device. Scan the QR code and the app will appear. It can take some time to load for the first time. Have fun ü•≥
