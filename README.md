# To-do Expo Application ✏️


I created an application with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) which runs on my Android device using [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client).

You can test it yourself if you [click on this link](https://expo.dev/@liadensam/TodoApp) with your phone:


- it will either let you know to install Expo Go
- or it will redirect you to the Expo Go and you can start trying it

Another possibility is to clone the repository:


```sh
git clone https://github.com/liadensam/expo-todo.git
```

And then install all dependencies  with:

```sh
npm install
```

And then run it by using:


```sh
expo start
```
